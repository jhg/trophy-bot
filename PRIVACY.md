# Privacy Policy

[Trophy Bot](https://github.com/AntikoreDev/trophy-bot) does **not** save any personal info
 about you, and can't read messages from users anyway.

## What data is handled by Trophy Bot?

[Trophy Bot](https://github.com/AntikoreDev/trophy-bot) handles custom commands to receive data
 and general use of the bot. Any data you send to these commands are handled by the bot,
 but **not** all data is stored.

## What data is stored by Trophy Bot?

[Trophy Bot](https://github.com/AntikoreDev/trophy-bot) stores data about trophies you create
 and award. That data includes every parameter you give to the trophy, such as the name, emoji,
 description etc, this is required in order to the proper work for the bot. It's based on
 legitimate interests: maintaining functionality, generating statistics, and debugging.

Images are also stored to prevent automatic Discord removal which would break the purpose of
 having good thumbnails for trophies. Removing a trophy will also remove any data about it
 including the thumbnail from the servers without persistence.

Awards and rewards are also stored to make the bot work properly, this means that some
 user IDs and role IDs are also saved.

Trophies are per-server, and the Server ID is saved to be linked to every content
 created with the bot.

When the bot handles an exception, it sends anonymized debug info (no user-identifying data)
 to the developer via Discord.

**Retention:** Error logs are stored only as long as necessary to fix bugs (maximum 30 days).

Any bug reports, stripped of personal data, will be published indefinitely as public GitHub issues.

## What data is visible for others?

[Trophy Bot](https://github.com/AntikoreDev/trophy-bot) works per server, and
 there is no way for other server to see trophies on yours, and no way to share
 any content between servers apart from the total trophy count, total award count
 and total commands ran in the `/stats` command.

## How can I remove my data?

Kicking the bot from your server won't remove any data stored for your server from it, for
 security reasons, but you can remove all of the data for your server including images using
 the command `/forgetme` without persistence (this will kick the bot itself too).

This command is only enabled to be performed by the server owner, to avoid malicious behaviour.

You may request access, rectification, erasure, restriction, objection, or portability. Contact via the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/kNmgU44xgU).

**Approximate response time:** 72 hours.

Any other questions you have about this, ask freely on the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/kNmgU44xgU)
