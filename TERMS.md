# Terms of Service

This software is provided "as is" without any warranty. Use at your own risk.

**To clarify,** these terms only apply to the bot's service provided by me,
 [AntikoreDev](https://www.antikore.dev/) (that means these are only applied for the
 actual use on the official bot). Any self-hosted versions or forks (thus, also self-hosted)
 are exempt to these terms **at my own operational level**. However, the [LICENSE](./LICENSE)
 should be still applied on any forks or self-hosted versions of the bot, as specified
 by its own conditions.<br>

I'm not responsible for any wrong use of the bot on forks or self-hosted versions.

By using [Trophy Bot](https://github.com/AntikoreDev/trophy-bot), you're implicitly agreeing
 with these terms, otherwise you should stop using it.

## List of terms

* We reserve the right to revoke access to the bot at any time for any reason without prior notice.

* Any use of this bot for any illegal and/or malicious behavior may result in revoking your rights to it.
